# Notebook App

This is a simple **Notebook Application** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. The app allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on notes.

## Features

- **Create** new notes
- **View** all notes
- **Edit** existing notes
- **Delete** notes

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing notes
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js
- **EJS**: Template engine for rendering HTML views
- **Method-Override**: Middleware for overriding HTTP methods in forms (to allow PUT and DELETE methods)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Ensure MongoDB is running locally)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/notebook-app.git
    cd notebook-app
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start MongoDB on your local machine:
    ```bash
    mongod
    ```

4. Run the server:
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

5. Visit `http://localhost:8080/notes` in your browser.

```

### MongoDB

This app connects to a MongoDB database named `notebook`. Ensure that MongoDB is running locally or provide a remote database URI in the `main()` function in `app.js`.

The `note.js` model includes the following fields:

- `title` (String): The title of the note.
- `containt` (String): The content of the note.
- `created_at` (Date): Timestamp for when the note was created.

### Routes

- `GET /notes` - Display all notes.
- `GET /notes/new` - Form for creating a new note.
- `POST /notes` - Add a new note to the database.
- `GET /notes/:id/edit` - Edit form for a specific note.
- `PUT /notes/:id` - Update a specific note.
- `DELETE /notes/:id` - Delete a specific note.

### Additional Info

- The app uses **method-override** to simulate `PUT` and `DELETE` HTTP requests since HTML forms only support `GET` and `POST`.
- Ensure that MongoDB is running on `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/notebook`.
